Tax project
Goal is to manage taxRelated Task by managing signup and CRUD operations

//approach

step 0 i have created two models user Model and taxModel and and ever tax document is linked with specific user (ref )

step 1 is to create sign up options for three kind of users taxPayer , taxAccountant , admin

in this project i have done this via Schema in mongoDB via mongoose by an option of selecting role user can select the role ['taxPayer','taxAcc','admin ']

for the simplicity this project it have scenario of only salesTax. and have capability of intigration with incomeTax also

details of apis
user sign up
userTaxCreation,3) 4)getTaxDetailsById, 5)getTaxDetailsFiltres,
markTaxPaid ,
createAndEditTaxDue
STAR (situation Task ACtion REsult )

apis are protected via authentication and authorization
json web token why? reduced the load of server for the authentication and authorization

when users Login they will rewarded token [in header ] which sent back to their browser with details like userId and role

when users comes next time . they need not to login, instead browser send the token to server in header .

server will decoded it and perform neccessary operations for authentiction and authorization .

most common one is checking the decoded token userId with userid of params or from request

validations and classifications of project
created index.js file route validator controllers middleware models seperately for the efficiency

please go through the code more information is available there via comments section

how i undo changes
i followed soft delete methods i.e every schema is have a key of isDeleted which has default boolean value false

when user wanna delete its account he/she just turn isDeletedkey to true . data wont be deleted but flagged and remain in database admin can change the status again
